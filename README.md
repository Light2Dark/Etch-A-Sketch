One of the hardest projects so far, especially because I wanted it to look nice and feature packed. Initially, I tried using an Etch A Sketch as the bg image and creating a grid following the image, but resizing issues makes this approach really difficult.

Then, I used CSS and cool fonts, shadows, styles to make the Etch A Sketch look really good. This was done using pure JS, next up is to learn some JQuery which I think would make some steps easier. Overall, its really fun, tiring and at times frustrating.

Thanks :)

P.S: There might be a bug where the whole etch-a-sketch screen turns black/random colour,, I'll try to fix it, but tell me if it happens to you.
