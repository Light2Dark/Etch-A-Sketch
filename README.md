https://light2dark.github.io/Etch-A-Sketch/

One of the hardest projects so far, especially because I wanted it to look nice and feature packed. Initially, I tried using an Etch A Sketch as the bg image and creating a grid following the image, but resizing issues makes this approach really difficult.

Then, I used CSS and cool fonts, shadows, styles to make the Etch A Sketch look really good. This was done using pure JS. 
Overall, its really fun, tiring and at times frustrating.

Update 2: Could be improved, added eraser, jukebox, sound effects, polished up a little. Made the bg look slightly better.

Thanks :)

P.S: There might be a bug where the whole etch-a-sketch screen turns black/random colour,, I'll try to fix it, but tell me if it happens to you.

Sound Effects:
